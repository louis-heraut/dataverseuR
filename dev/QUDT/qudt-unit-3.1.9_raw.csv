"http://qudt.org/vocab/unit/YR_TROPICAL","Tropical Year","en","a{tropical}","a_t","<p>A tropical year (also known as a solar year), for general purposes, is the length of time that the Sun takes to return to the same position in the cycle of seasons, as seen from Earth; for example, the time from vernal equinox to vernal equinox, or from summer solstice to summer solstice. Because of the precession of the equinoxes, the seasonal cycle does not remain exactly synchronised with the position of the Earth in its orbit around the Sun. As a consequence, the tropical year is about 20 minutes shorter than the time it takes Earth to complete one full orbit around the Sun as measured with respect to the fixed stars. Since antiquity, astronomers have progressively refined the definition of the tropical year, and currently define it as the time required for the mean Sun's tropical longitude (longitudinal position along the ecliptic relative to its position at the vernal equinox) to increase by 360 degrees (that is, to complete one full seasonal circuit).</p>"

It is defined as one twelfth of the mass of an unbound neutral atom of carbon-12 in its nuclear and electronic ground state,[ and has a value of $1.660538921(73) \times 10^{-27} kg$. One dalton is approximately equal to the mass of one nucleon; an equivalence of saying $1 g mol^{-1}$.

The intensity of a magnetic field can be measured by placing a current-carrying conductor in the field. The magnetic field exerts a force on the conductor, a force which depends on the amount of the current and on the length of the conductor. One tesla is defined as the field intensity generating one newton of force per ampere of current per meter of conductor. Equivalently, one tesla represents a magnetic flux density of one weber per square meter of area. A field of one tesla is quite strong: the strongest fields available in laboratories are about 20 teslas, and the Earth's magnetic flux density, at its surface, is about 50 microteslas.

"http://qudt.org/vocab/unit/S","西门子","zh","S","S","$\textit{Siemens}$ is the SI unit of electric conductance, susceptance, and admittance. 
The most important property of a conductor is the amount of current it will carry when a voltage is applied. 
Current flow is opposed by resistance in all circuits, and by also by reactance and impedance in alternating current circuits. 
Conductance, susceptance, and admittance are the inverses of resistance, reactance, and impedance, respectively. 
To measure these properties, the siemens is the reciprocal of the ohm. In other words, the conductance, susceptance, or admittance, in siemens, is simply 1 divided by the resistance, reactance or impedance, respectively, in ohms. 
The unit is named for the German electrical engineer Werner von Siemens (1816-1892).

It was originally defined in CGS units in 1953 as the dose causing 100 ergs of energy to be absorbed by one gram of matter. It has been replaced by the gray in most of the world. A related unit, the $roentgen$, was formerly used to quantify the number of rad deposited into a target when it was exposed to radiation. The F-factor can used to convert between rad and roentgens.

  In chemistry the unit $\textit{pH}$, also referred to as $\textit{acidity}$ or $\textit{basicity}$,
   is the negative logarithm (base 10) of the concentration of free protons (or hydronium ions).
  The definition of $pH$ in terms of hydrogen ions in solution is:

  $$\text{pH}=-\log_{10}(a_{H^+})\equiv-\log_{10}\left(\left[H^+\right]\right)$$

  Where $a_{H^+}$ is the equilibrium molar concentration of $H^+$ in the solution, the activity of
   the hydrogen ion in the solution.
  $$$$
  This definition is appropriate for concentrations equal to, or less than $1\ mol/l$, 
   where $aH+ \equiv [H+]$, that is, $1\ mol/L\ HCl$ has a $pH$ of zero.
  $$$$
  To relate this to standard molality ($b^\circ$), typically taken as $1 \ mol/kg$, 
   consideration is given to the activity ($a_{H^+}$) of the hydrogen ions.
  $$$$
  The activity can be expressed as:

  $$a_{H^+} = \gamma_{H^+} \times m_{H^+}$$ 

  Where, $\gamma_{H^+}$ is the activity coefficient, which adjusts the molality to account for
   non-ideal behavior due to interactions between ions in the solution.
  $m_{H^+}$ is the molality of hydrogen ions in the solution relative to the standard molality, 
   expressed in $mol/kg$.
  $$$$
  The expansion of $pH$ then becomes:

  $$\text{pH} = -log_{10}\left(m_{H+}\times\gamma_{H^+}\right)$$

  $$$$
  This definition is relevant in more concentrated solutions or when precise thermodynamic calculations are required. 
  It reflects how the properties of the solution deviate from ideal behavior and provides a more accurate understanding of the $pH$ under various conditions.
  $$$$
  While $pH$ is a universally recognized scale for expressing hydrogen ion activity,
  its appropriateness and accuracy can diminish under conditions of extremely high
  ionic strength, non-aqueous environments, high temperatures, or very high or low $pH$ values.
  In such cases, alternative measurement strategies might be required to obtain meaningful and accurate descriptions of acidity or basicity.

"http://qudt.org/vocab/unit/PERMITTIVITY_REL","Relative Permittivity","en","εᵣ","[eps_0]","
  The $\textit{relative permittivity}$ of a material under given conditions reflects the extent to which it concentrates electrostatic lines of flux. 
  In technical terms, it is the ratio of the amount of electrical energy stored in a material by an applied voltage, 
  relative to that stored in a vacuum. 
  Likewise, it is also the ratio of the capacitance of a capacitor using that material as a dielectric, compared to a similar capacitor that has a vacuum as its dielectric. 
  Relative permittivity is a dimensionless number that is in general complex. 
  The imaginary portion of the permittivity corresponds to a phase shift of the polarization $P$ relative to $E$ and leads to the attenuation of electromagnetic waves passing through the medium.
  $$\epsilon_r(w) = \frac{\epsilon(w)}{\epsilon_O}$$,
   where $\epsilon_r(w)$ is the complex frequency-dependent absolute permittivity of the material,
    and $\epsilon_O$ is the vacuum permittivity.

Usually, pica measurements are represented with an upper-case 'P' with an upper-right-to-lower-left virgule (slash) starting in the upper right portion of the 'P' and ending at the lower left of the upright portion of the 'P'; essentially drawing a virgule (/) through a 'P'.

It has the unit symbol Np. The unit's name is derived from the name of John Napier, the inventor of logarithms. As is the case for the decibel and bel, the neper is not a unit in the International System of Units (SI), but it is accepted for use alongside the SI. Like the decibel, the neper is a unit in a logarithmic scale. While the bel uses the decadic (base-10) logarithm to compute ratios, the neper uses the natural logarithm, based on Euler's number"

The $\textit{normal cubic metre}$ is a unit for liquid products conforming to the Dutch Mining Regulations (Mijnbouwregeling) for reporting in the Dutch oil and gas industry, and used predominantly for crude oil. As such, it is a measure of the actual amount of oil, not the volume of the oil. The reference conditions for a Dutch normal cubic metre are 0 degrees Celsius at 1 standard atmosphere (atm), equivalent to 101.325 kilopascals (kPa) of pressure.

  The $\textit{mole}$ is a unit of measurement used in chemistry to express amounts of a chemical substance. 
  The official definition, adopted as part of the SI system in 1971, is that one mole of a substance contains just as many elementary entities (atoms, molecules, ions, or other kinds of particles) as there are atoms in 12 grams of carbon-12 (carbon-12 is the most common atomic form of carbon, consisting of atoms having 6 protons and 6 neutrons).
  This corresponds to a value of $6.02214179(30) \times 10^{23}$ elementary entities of the substance. 
  It is one of the base units in the International System of Units, and has the unit symbol $mol$. 
  A Mole is the SI base unit of the amount of a substance (as distinct from its mass or weight). 
  Moles measure the actual number of atoms or molecules in an object. 
  An earlier name is gram molecular weight, because one mole of a chemical compound is the same number of grams as the molecular weight of a molecule of that compound measured in atomic mass units.

  This corresponds to a value of $6.02214179(30) \times 10^{23}$ elementary entities of the substance. 
  It is one of the base units in the International System of Units, and has the unit symbol $mol$. 
  A Mole is the SI base unit of the amount of a substance (as distinct from its mass or weight). 
  Moles measure the actual number of atoms or molecules in an object. 
  An earlier name is gram molecular weight, because one mole of a chemical compound is the same number of grams as the molecular weight of a molecule of that compound measured in atomic mass units.

The United States adopted this international mile for most purposes, but retained the pre-1959 mile for some land-survey data, terming it the US survey mile. In the US, statute mile formally refers to the survey mile, about 3.219 mm (1/8 inch) longer than the international mile (the international mile is exactly 0.0002% less than the US survey mile)."

  The unit $\textit{Kelvin}$ is the SI base unit of temperature, previously called the degree Kelvin. 
  One kelvin represents the same temperature difference as one degree Celsius. 
  In 1967 the General Conference on Weights and Measures defined the temperature of the triple point of water
   (the temperature at which water exists simultaneously in the gaseous, liquid, and solid states) to be exactly 273.16 kelvins. 
  Since this temperature is also equal to 0.01 u00b0C, the temperature in kelvins is always equal to 273.15 plus the temperature in degrees Celsius. 
  The kelvin equals exactly 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit. 
  The unit is named for the British mathematician and physicist William Thomson (1824-1907),
   later known as Lord Kelvin after he was named Baron Kelvin of Largs.

In the equation for torque on a moment, the torque is measured in joules and the magnetic field in tesla, so the moment is measured in Joules per Tesla (J u00b7T-1).

A mean sidereal day is about 23 h 56 m 4.1 s in length. However, due to variations in the rotation rate of the Earth, the rate of an ideal sidereal clock deviates from any simple multiple of a civil clock. In practice, the difference is kept track of by the difference UTC-UT1, which is measured by radio telescopes and kept on file and available to the public at the IERS and at the United States Naval Observatory. A Sidereal Hour is $1/24^{th}$ of a Sidereal Day. A mean sidereal day is 23 hours, 56 minutes, 4.0916 seconds (23.9344699 hours or 0.99726958 mean solar days), the time it takes Earth to make one rotation relative to the vernal equinox. (Due to nutation, an actual sidereal day is not quite so constant.) The vernal equinox itself precesses slowly westward relative to the fixed stars, completing one revolution in about 26,000 years, so the misnamed sidereal day (""sidereal"" is derived from the Latin sidus meaning ""star"") is 0.0084 seconds shorter than Earth's period of rotation relative to the fixed stars."

  The unit $\textit{Henry}$ is the SI unit of electric inductance. 
  A changing magnetic field induces an electric current in a loop of wire (or in a coil of many loops) located in the field. 
  Although the induced voltage depends only on the rate at which the magnetic flux changes, measured in webers per second, the amount of the current depends also on the physical properties of the coil. 
  A coil with an inductance of one henry requires a flux of one weber for each ampere of induced current. 
  If, on the other hand, it is the current which changes, then the induced field will generate a potential difference within the coil: 
  if the inductance is one henry a current change of one ampere per second generates a potential difference of one volt. 
  The henry is a large unit; inductances in practical circuits are measured in millihenrys (mH) or microhenrys (u03bc H). 
  The unit is named for the American physicist Joseph Henry (1797-1878), one of several scientists who discovered independently how magnetic fields can be used to generate alternating currents. 

  A $\textit{Henry}$ is defined as:

  $$\text{H} \; \equiv \; \text{henry}\; \equiv\; \frac{\text{Wb}}{\text{A}}\; \equiv\; \frac{\text{weber}}{\text{amp}}\; \equiv\ \frac{\text{V}\cdot\text{s}}{\text{A}}\; \equiv\; \frac{\text{volt} \cdot \text{second}}{\text{amp}}\; \equiv\ \Omega\cdot\text{s}\; \equiv\; \text{ohm.second}$$

  The unit $\textit{Henry}$ is the SI unit of electric inductance. 
  A changing magnetic field induces an electric current in a loop of wire (or in a coil of many loops) located in the field. 
  Although the induced voltage depends only on the rate at which the magnetic flux changes, measured in webers per second, the amount of the current depends also on the physical properties of the coil. 
  A coil with an inductance of one henry requires a flux of one weber for each ampere of induced current. 
  If, on the other hand, it is the current which changes, then the induced field will generate a potential difference within the coil: 
  if the inductance is one henry a current change of one ampere per second generates a potential difference of one volt. 
  The henry is a large unit; inductances in practical circuits are measured in millihenrys (mH) or microhenrys (u03bc H).

  One gauss is defined as one maxwell per square centimeter; it equals $10^{-4} tesla$ (or $100 micro T$). 
  The Gauss is identical to maxwells per square centimetre; technically defined in a three-dimensional system, 
  it corresponds in the SI, with its extra base unit the ampere.

Applied to yarn, a denier was held to be equal in weight to 1/24 of an ounce. The term microdenier is used to describe filaments that weigh less than one gram per 9,000 meter length."

  The unit $\textit{Celsius}$, also known as centigrade, is a scale and unit of measurement for temperature. 
  It can refer to a specific temperature on the Celsius scale as well as a unit to indicate a temperature interval, 
  a difference between two temperatures or an uncertainty. 
  This definition fixes the magnitude of both the degree Celsius and the kelvin as precisely 1 part 
  in 273.16 (approximately 0.00366) of the difference between absolute zero and the triple point of water. 
  Thus, it sets the magnitude of one degree Celsius and that of one kelvin as exactly the same. 
  Additionally, it establishes the difference between the two scales' null points as being precisely $273.15^{\circ}\text{C}$.

"http://qudt.org/vocab/unit/DECADE","Dec","en","dec",NA,"One decade is a factor of 10 difference between two numbers (an order of magnitude difference) measured on a logarithmic scale. It is especially useful when referring to frequencies and when describing frequency response of electronic systems, such as audio amplifiers and filters. The factor-of-ten in a decade can be in either direction: so one decade up from 100 Hz is 1000 Hz, and one decade down is 10 Hz. The factor-of-ten is what is important, not the unit used, so $3.14 rad/s$ is one decade down from $31.4 rad/s$."

"http://qudt.org/vocab/unit/C","库伦","zh","C","C","The SI unit of electric charge. One coulomb is the amount of charge accumulated in one second by a current of one ampere. Electricity is actually a flow of charged particles, such as electrons, protons, or ions. The charge on one of these particles is a whole-number multiple of the charge e on a single electron, and one coulomb represents a charge of approximately 6.241 506 x 1018 e.

  The $\textit{Becquerel}$ is the SI derived unit of activity, usually meaning radioactivity.
  Radioactivity is caused when atoms disintegrate, ejecting energetic particles. 
  One becquerel is the radiation caused by one disintegration per second; 
  this is equivalent to about $27.0270 \text{picocuries (pCi)}$. 
  The unit is named for a French physicist, Antoine-Henri Becquerel (1852-1908), 
  the discoverer of radioactivity. 
  Note: both the becquerel and the hertz are basically defined as one event per second, 
  yet they measure different things. 
  The hertz is used to measure the rates of events that happen periodically in a fixed and definite cycle. 
  The becquerel is used to measure the rates of events that happen sporadically and unpredictably, 
  not in a definite cycle.

   An ampere-hour or amp-hour (symbol $Ah,\,AHr,\, A \cdot h, A h$) is a unit of electric
    charge, with sub-units milliampere-hour ($mAh$) and milliampere second ($mAs$).
    One ampere-hour is equal to 3600 coulombs (ampere-seconds), the electric charge transferred
     by a steady current of one ampere for one hour. 
    The ampere-hour is frequently used in measurements of electrochemical systems such as
     electroplating and electrical batteries. 
    The commonly seen milliampere-hour ($mAh$ or $mA \cdot h$) is one-thousandth of an
